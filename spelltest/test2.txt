Hey, I found a mispelt word!

Obviously, I can't tell the diference between there, their, and they're
but nobody is perfect, I guess.

We also need to make sure proper nouns like English are recognised while
words like english are not, because that should be capitalised. Also,
an acronym like RCA *might* be okay, whereas rca might not and rCA most
definitely should not
