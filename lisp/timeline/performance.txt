sbcl-twitter is an custom sbcl executable image. for performance, i
tweaked the code a bit: with the new core, I skipped the calls to 
ql:quickload because those libraries are already present (the image
has drakma, cl-json, and flex-streams pre-loaded). It was created
with the following:

; note that I have quicklisp autoloaded in my .sbclrc
(ql:quickload "drakma")
(ql:quickload "cl-json")
(ql:quickload "flexi-streams")
(sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die "sbcl-twitter" :executable t)
