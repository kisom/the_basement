copy the executables somewhere in your path

make sure you have geoip and pygeoip installed

download the datafile:
    wget http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz
gunzip the datafile and copy it to wherever your geoip datafiles are, i.e.
    /usr/share/GeoIP

edit geoip_lu -> change database to point to where you copied the datafile

run the shell script with the path to access.log or error.log as an argument

for best results, redirect the output to a file

if you want, specify a second argument as a blacklist, which is a plaintext
file with one ip / line, i.e.

<sterling: ~/tmp> $ cat blacklist.dat
1.2.3.4
2.3.4.5
3.4.5.6
<sterling: ~/tmp> $
