various bits and pieces of code, all thrown in here to keep them synced
up if i want to tinker.

sh:         shell scripts. oh god the bourne shell was everywhere...
xw:         xterm wrapper - execute the command line with xterm -e or an
            alternative, specifiable via an environment variable or a
            config file. would take about 30 seconds in shell, but that's
            no fun.
defscan:    scan headers for unused #defines.
cproj:      a tool to work with c projects. it's rad.
